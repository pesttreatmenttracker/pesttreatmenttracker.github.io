<p>If pesticides are essential, they are selected and applied in such a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices. Almost every type of pest poses a threat to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in organic farming might control some pests, but can adversely impact natural enemies and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural enemy populations, however a higher variety of natural opponents does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize fossil fuels and indirectly have an unfavorable effect on the environment.</p>
