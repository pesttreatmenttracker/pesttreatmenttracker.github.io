In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is restricted to high worth (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly fixated cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been regularly using a number of these IPM techniques for years and even generations - methods such as crop rotation, not planting crops in areas prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant ranges.
