Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off because growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>Pest Management reality sheets Data on arthropod pest abundance, area within the greenhouse, and population trends (boosts, reduces, or steady) help figure out the efficiency of pest management techniques. IPM techniques consist of the introduction of predators and particular parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects).
