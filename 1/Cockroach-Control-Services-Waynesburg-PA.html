Here, insecticides will only be used when they are economically possible and it appears that natural enemies will not control the pests. Crop rotation: Monocultures offer potential cotton pests with plentiful food sources, causing their populations to increase quickly.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of strategies such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the national or local level in a lot of countries, and in many it has ended up being official governmental policy. The use of chemical agents to handle either regular pest mitigation or more established infestations should be delegated professional pest management companies who are trained and certified in accordance with state policies and health and wellness standards.</p>

These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that lower the plant's attractiveness or viability for the pest to feed, establish, or replicate effectively.</p>
