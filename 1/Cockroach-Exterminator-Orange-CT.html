<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.

The pest control market is just starting to understand the chances to enhance our business with mobile and social innovation-- but the possibilities are endless.</p>
