After executing any pest management technique, inspect the indicator plants to assess if arthropod pests have actually been eliminated and evaluate the efficiency and durability of control.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxins in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
