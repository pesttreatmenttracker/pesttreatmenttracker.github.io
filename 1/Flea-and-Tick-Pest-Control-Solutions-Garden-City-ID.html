<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>It is also obvious from lots of discussions with growers and pest control professionals in California that resistance management viewed as rotating pesticides amongst various mode of action groups is commonly viewed as IPM, although resistance management is just a part of IPM.
