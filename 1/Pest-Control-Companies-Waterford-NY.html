Use floating row covers as short-term barriers to get plants past critical stages, such as when they are seedlings or while the pest you are deterring is most active. Numerous insect pest types now possess resistance to some or numerous types of insecticides, and few chemical control alternatives exist for these pests.</p>
<p>These unidentified or inadequately understood possible hazards argue for extra levels of protection consisting of direct exposures to multiple pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care items; and the general difficulty in attributing chronic diseases to any one particular cause.</p>
