Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for establishment of reliable and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
<p>Also, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the same location may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control relates to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area tidy and free of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of the flooring and a door.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply selected biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators use different kinds of pesticides and baits to kill and remove pests. Reliable, long-term restorative actions can then be required to avoid pests from getting in the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
