With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a ecologically benign and affordable  pest control strategy preferably matched for both small and large farmers all over the world. When termites have gone into a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they likewise damage paper, cloth, carpets and more.

Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you want your termite treatment to result in termite extermination.

<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of moral and reasonable considerations were discovered to the motorists in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
