	<meta name="description" content="Pest Control Cockroaches in Pittsburg KS - Potential problems include pesticide resistance, resurgence of insect pests, pesticide poisoning, environmental toxicity, elimination of predator species, negative outcomes for other non-target organisms, disruption in the food web, increased prevalence of pesticide residues in food, and reduced rice yields ( Aktar et al., 2009 ; Sharma et al., 2015 ). These problems could be avoided by implementation of well-designed IPM strategies ( Mohd Fuad et al., 2012 ; Srinivasan, 2012 ; Sharma et al., 2015 ). Despite several IPM techniques specifically designed for rice production, however, adoption remains low because of the perception that chemical-free” strategies are less effective than heavy insecticide application.">
