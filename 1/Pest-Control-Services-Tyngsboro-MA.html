<p>Generally, the primary objective of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that might hinder the management objectives of sites such as residential and industrial structures, lawn and turf areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
