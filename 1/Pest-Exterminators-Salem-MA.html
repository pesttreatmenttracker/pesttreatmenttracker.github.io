<p>If, after following preventive and scheduled management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use chosen biopesticides with low ecological effect. Expert exterminators utilize different types of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests.

<p>Choose an effective management method that will have the least quantity of impact on other living animals and the environment if a pest or disease triggers inappropriate damage despite preventative efforts.
