<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>The service received (Cockroach control) was really timely and professional. When pest or diseases levels are low and actions most effective, early detection of illness and pests leads to timely action. These pests also carry damaging germs and illness on their bodies that can be transferred to individuals who enter contact with their droppings, urine and polluted surfaces or products.</p>
<p>For the most part, they will be. If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide might kill them, permitting the pest population to rebound uninhibited by parasites and predators, which might have been providing significant control. The pest control industry is just beginning to understand the chances to improve our business with social and mobile technology-- but the possibilities are endless.</p>
