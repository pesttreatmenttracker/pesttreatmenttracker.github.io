<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and reduce risk from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that decreases general economic, health, and ecological threats.</p>
<p>United States Department of Farming, Agricultural Research Study Service, Plant Pest Control Division, Study and Detection Operations. An Integrated Pest Management method can be utilized for crops and livestock pest management, and in the home garden. Founded locally in 1976, we put our decades of pest management experience to operate in every pest control service we provide.</p>
<p>You just need to invest an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by worldwide concerns: the vicious cycle that develops from making use of large quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important element of artificial fertilizer, phosphate, will practically have run out.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the exact same principles as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
