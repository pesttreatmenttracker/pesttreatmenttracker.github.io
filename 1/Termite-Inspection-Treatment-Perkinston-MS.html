Paperwork would be difficult to obtain even if concerted efforts were made due to the multiple possible causes for brief and long-lasting signs and health problems related to direct exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.
