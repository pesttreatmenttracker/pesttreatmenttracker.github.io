<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>

Not taking appropriate procedures to avoid and control pests can cause significant monetary expenses to the business from stock and product loss, item recall, loss of reputation and legal action that might eventually trigger the closure of the business.</p>
