<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and possess many of the environmental and human security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Termites consume furnishings, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, hence causing gigantic damage within just a couple of months.
