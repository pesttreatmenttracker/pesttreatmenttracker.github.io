<p>A particular pest can be controlled by specific options, however they may not all be readily available in a specific place, for a particular crop, or within the readily available financial means. IPM involves utilizing the very best mix of cultural, chemical and biological measures for particular scenarios, consisting of plant biotechnology as appropriate.

<p>They are picked and applied in a way that prevents disrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are required. Nearly every kind of pest presents a risk to the residential or commercial properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
