<p>A particular pest can be controlled by specific options, however they may not all be readily available in a specific place, for a particular crop, or within the readily available financial means. IPM involves utilizing the very best mix of cultural, chemical and biological measures for particular scenarios, consisting of plant biotechnology as appropriate.
