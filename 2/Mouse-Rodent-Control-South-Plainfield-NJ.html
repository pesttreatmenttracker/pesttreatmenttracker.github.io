<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and are subject to greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). Simply put, an effective, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm break out might be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, thereby reinforcing the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.</p>
