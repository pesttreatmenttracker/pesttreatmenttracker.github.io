<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan.

<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very reliable in causing significant decreases in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or conserving natural enemy populations by providing sanctuaries or avoiding practices that harm them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>These pests get in houses from the structure foundation and for this reason trigger damage to walls and wood structures. But excess usage of pesticides, renewal of small pest, ecological imbalance, residue pesticide in food and ecological contamination. On the other hand, pest control will include killing bugs, insects, rats, squirrels as needed (in as humanely a style as possible).</p>
