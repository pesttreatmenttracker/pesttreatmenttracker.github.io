<h2>How To Hire a Residential Pest Exterminator Company in Union Grove</h2>

<p>Termites are nasty consumers. For some tasks, pest control workers use a combination of pest management methods, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though contested by some as a legitimate step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the increase of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels.

IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
