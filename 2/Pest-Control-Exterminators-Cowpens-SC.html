D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to artificial chemicals, and have many of the human and environmental security dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
