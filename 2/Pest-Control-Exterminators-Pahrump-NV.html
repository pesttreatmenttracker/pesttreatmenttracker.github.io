Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al.

If your center presently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
