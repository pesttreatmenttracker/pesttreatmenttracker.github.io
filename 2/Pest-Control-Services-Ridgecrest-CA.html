<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very effective in triggering substantial reductions in pest populations in specific circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or conserving natural enemy populations by offering refuges or preventing practices that damage them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or prevented far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide problems are brought on by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
