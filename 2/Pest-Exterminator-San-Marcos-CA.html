Therefore, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although handy in decreasing ecological contamination and safety problems, still does not really address the ecologically based weakness of the standard pest control technique.</p>

Biopesticides are normally compatible with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>
