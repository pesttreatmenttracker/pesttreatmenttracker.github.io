<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are devoted to offering the very best possible service to secure against unwanted pests. The following example explains the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing primarily on long-lasting pest avoidance, a successful IPM program makes use of a combination of control approaches including biological control, habitat control, modifications to cultural practices and use of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>Continuous monitoring and tracking of insect pests population is important for evaluation of damage and for determining the requirements for actions to be taken.

To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
