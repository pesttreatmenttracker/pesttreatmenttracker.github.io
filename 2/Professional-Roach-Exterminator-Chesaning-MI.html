<p>Reliable, less risky pest controls are selected first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as scents to interrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is frequently among the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has created.</p>
