An efficient IPM program consists of pesticides for avoidance and active treatment. Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungi, microsporidia, nematodes, or infections, and fermentation byproducts of some microbes against arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens generally come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
