<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is usually utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has actually been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a big variety of pests discovered in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders. Sprays, are best used against flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas A lot of insects will die within minutes of coming into contact with an insecticide spray, but some persistent bugs might make you spray the area multiple times prior to quiting.</p>
