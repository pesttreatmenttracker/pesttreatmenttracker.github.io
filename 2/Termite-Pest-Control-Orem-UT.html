<p>Effective, less dangerous pest controls are picked first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interfere with pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Assessment is typically among the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the outcomes it has produced.</p>
