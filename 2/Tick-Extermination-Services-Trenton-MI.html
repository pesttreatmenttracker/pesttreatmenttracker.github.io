It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides might be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds change for modifications in market prices, stage of crop development, cost of pesticides, etc., but in truth most are based on fixed invasion or damage levels.</p>
<p>There are several actions to take to ensure permanent removal of these pests if you recognize rogue rodents.
