<p>At the same time, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or hindered away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide problems are brought on by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
