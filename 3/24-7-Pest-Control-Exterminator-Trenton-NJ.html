<p>Todays specialists use Integrated Pest Management methods which include traps and exclusion approaches to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests consist of cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "house" ants (omitting carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny crazy ants), clothes moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, home crickets and paper wasps.</p>
<p>The many differing threats from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
<p>These pests enter homes from the structure foundation and for this reason trigger damage to walls and wood structures. But excess usage of pesticides, revival of minor pest, ecological imbalance, residue pesticide in food and environmental contamination.
