<p>The determination of the proper reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural opponents than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are immense straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not mix pesticides. There are 4 significant parts in the new IPM model that resolve numerous pest management options, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to address the pest issue, preparation and organization of details to take proper management actions, and maintaining good interaction to distribute and obtain understanding about pests and their management.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators use different kinds of baits and pesticides to eliminate and remove pests. Efficient, irreversible restorative actions can then be taken to avoid pests from entering the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
