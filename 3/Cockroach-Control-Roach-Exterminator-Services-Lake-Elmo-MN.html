IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will make sure beneficial financial condition, social and environmental effects 13 and is applicable to a lot of agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
<p>The technique to be chosen for IPM depends on lots of aspects, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests cause significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.
