<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of rational and moral considerations were found to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM application in developed countries.</p>
<p>Improvements in pest management are needed, and pesticides will likely constantly be a part of the solution.
