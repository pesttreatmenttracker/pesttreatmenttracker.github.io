<h3>Modern Pest-Control Techniques Moorhead MN</h3>
<p>A biological control program can prosper if these suggestions are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a trustworthy biological control provider, 3) ensure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural opponents, 4) stress that proper shipping procedures be followed, and 5) get instructions from biological control suppliers on correct release rates and timing of application.</p>
<p>Of course, you could keep the crop covered for its entire life expectancy, although this isn't a good choice for crops that need insect pollination.
