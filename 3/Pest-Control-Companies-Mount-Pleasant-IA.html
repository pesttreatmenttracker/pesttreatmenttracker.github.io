Standards and legislation regarding the use, permitted techniques of application and the storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals differ from country to country, often being enacted laws by each state of area. Research and outreach are an integral part of the IPM model to anticipate and determine pest problems, develop curative and preventive strategies, and successfully share the details through conventional and contemporary communication tools and methods.</p>

Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus professionals need to have -stressing the more comprehensive ecology of pest management and preventing harmful chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
