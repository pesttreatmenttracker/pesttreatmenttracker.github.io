The majority of people normally think about pest control throughout the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their yards and houses, however, pests understand no season.

<p>Normally, the primary aim of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of websites such as residential and industrial structures, yard and grass areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a number of the same principles as IPM however limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
