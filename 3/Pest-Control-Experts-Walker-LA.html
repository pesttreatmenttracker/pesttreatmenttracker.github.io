<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into different groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from various mode of action groups is advised to reduce the danger of resistance advancement (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ). Federal government policies restrict the time and quantity of particular chemical pesticides and help reduce the associated dangers.</p>
<p>Eliminate or cover bird cages and aquarium, and move other animals before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Make certain the person who will be using your pesticides holds a valid photo ID Pest Control Licence. Customers should inform the pest exterminators about the specific problems before the treatment or at the time of booking.
