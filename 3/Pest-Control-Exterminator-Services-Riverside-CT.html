<p>In Asia, various stages of IPM have actually been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>It is a proactive approach to managing pests," says Dr. Siddiqi, and uses chemicals only as a last option. Many pest control employees begin as assistants and get on-the-job training. Nests and hives: When you can see hives and nests around your house, it implies that there are a lot of pests doing their dirty work. The main approach is to promote beneficial insects that parasitize or eat target pests.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
