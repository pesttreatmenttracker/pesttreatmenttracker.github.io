Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though challenged by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial economic condition, social and environmental effects 13 and is applicable to a lot of farming, public health and facility pest management circumstances.</p>
