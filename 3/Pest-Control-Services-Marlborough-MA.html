<p>The red imported fire ant is a problematic and widely known pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after regular tracking shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to artificial chemicals, and have a number of the human and environmental security threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
<h3>Best Pest Control Near Me Marlborough Massachusetts</h2>
