The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many private commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in limited areas.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later expanded to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
