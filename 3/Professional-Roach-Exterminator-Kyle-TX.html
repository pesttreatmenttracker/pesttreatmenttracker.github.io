<p>These unidentified or poorly understood potential threats argue for extra levels of security consisting of direct exposures to several pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet plan; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and personal care products; and the basic problem in attributing persistent diseases to any one specific cause.</p>
<p>The professional user must keep using pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are required, e.g. by lowered dosages, minimized application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of risk in plants is acceptable and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>

Requirements of infested locations and differentiated application of plant protection products lessen the damage for human beings and nature as chemicals are used only when it is truly essential.</p>
