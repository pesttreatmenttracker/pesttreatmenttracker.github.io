Such was possibly the nature of the most heralded IPM success worldwide, the control of the brown planthopper, Nila parvata lugens, in Southeast Asia (Kenmore 1996).

To lessen prospective harm to useful insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
