Due to this principle of incorporating all readily available methods of pest control was accepted which can get rid of the situation told early. Such was possibly the nature of the most heralded IPM success worldwide, the control of the brown planthopper, Nila parvata lugens, in Southeast Asia (Kenmore 1996).

<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are selected and used in such a way that avoids interfering with other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest positions a hazard to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>

To lessen prospective harm to useful insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
