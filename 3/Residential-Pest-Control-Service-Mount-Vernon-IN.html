<p>In recommendation to the concept of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to welcome collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
