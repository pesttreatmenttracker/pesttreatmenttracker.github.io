Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans might not call for interventions unless the pests are many or rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>They are picked and used in a way that prevents interrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are needed. Almost every kind of pest postures a risk to the homes they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.

<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are selected first, including extremely targeted chemicals, such as scents to interrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is typically one of the most important steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ).
