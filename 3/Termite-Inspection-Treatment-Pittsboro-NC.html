<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a efficient and ecologically sensitive  method to pest control. These might or may not include products listed on the Organic Products Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in natural farming and natural gardening are normally much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more environmentally friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
