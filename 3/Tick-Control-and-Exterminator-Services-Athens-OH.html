<p>There are two various kinds of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest facility, dispersal, reproduction, and survival.

<p>Lots of newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- pyrethrum, insect and nicotine juvenile hormonal agent analogues), but the toxophore or active part might be altered to offer increased biological activity or stability. Most scientists agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>On the other hand, insecticides that are more selective because they are most reliable versus insects with specific feeding habits, at specific life stages, or within certain taxonomic groups, are described as "biorational" pesticides.
