<p>There are two various kinds of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest facility, dispersal, reproduction, and survival.

Most scientists agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>On the other hand, insecticides that are more selective because they are most reliable versus insects with specific feeding habits, at specific life stages, or within certain taxonomic groups, are described as "biorational" pesticides.
